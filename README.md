# fallout-console-Ao3
A fallout console workskin for Ao3

The fonts are websafe as opposed to 100% cannon accurate.

Some undestanding of css and html is required to use this workskin, but I don't mind explaining and will make an Ao3 tutorial. It works best as a div tag wrapping around the text you want to be a console.
